# Malaria Classification Project
This study investigates malaria trends and treatment outcomes among sampled patients from the Guratopp Rayfield Primary Health Care (PHC) based on data analytics and machine learning. Findings revealed that majority of the sampled patients were aged between 15 to 45 years, with an average age of 28 years and few outlier ages above 85 years which weren’t considered in the analysis. 

The study reveals that the most common age groups affected by malaria are teenagers and young adults. Similarly, Rapid Diagnostic Tests (mRDT) are significantly more prevalent than Microscopy (MP) tests, with majority of the tests yielding positive results. Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) drugs were widely administered, with four doses being the most frequent regimen – thus correlating with higher resistance levels.  

The study found that patients between 17 and 45 years old exhibited higher resistance to malaria, those treated with ACT drugs and positive test results were associated with increased drug resistance while age and test results were identified as key predictors of malaria prevalence among the patients.
